# tnet

A simple neural network from scratch in Python using only NumPy. The neural network is designed to predict the gender of a person based on their height and weight data. 

The [sigmoid activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) is used for the neurons in the hidden layer. It squashes the output of each neuron between 0 and 1, introducing non-linearity to the model.

[Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) is used to train the neural network
